# mmci-cli

Octave/Matlab code for the macroeconomic comparison using the macroeconomic model database (MMB). This is a command-line based backend for the mmb-gui-electron (the graphical user interface used from MMB v.3.0 onwards). 

This is not intended to be used as a standalone (which is possible but yet undocumented).
